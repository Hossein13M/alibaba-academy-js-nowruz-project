## Challenge 7:
We have a warehouse system which we stock some products in it. We desire to get each product's count, price, and name. We may sell a product,
which results in decreasing the product's count. We also need to enable/disable items from the warehouse.  Write the following functions:
- Write a function to get the count of all the items in the warehouse combined. (item1 count + item2 count + ...).
- Declare a function to create a new item with the given count.
- We need to have a function for selling the items.
- Write down a function to give a list of all the items that they are available (their count is above 0).
- Write down a function to disable/enable an item from the warehouse.
- Write down a function to change the count of an item from the warehouse.
- We need to have a function to edit the item from the warehouse for example their name.
- Declare a function to calculate price of all the items that have been sold. (For this you need to store the items that have been sold in an array or something)
- We need to check the warehouse's value by calculating the price of all the available items.
